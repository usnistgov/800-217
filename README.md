# Call for Comments on the Initial Public Draft of SP 800-217: Guidelines for the Use of Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Credentials with Federation

## Summary
NIST requests comments on the initial public draft of Special Publication 800-217, _Guidelines for the Use of Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Credentials with Federation_.  This publication complements [FIPS 201-3](https://pages.nist.gov/FIPS201/), which defines the requirements and characteristics of government-wide interoperable identity credentials used by federal employees and contractors. The draft guidelines in SP 800-217 provide technical requirements on the use of federated PIV identity and the use of assertions to implement PIV federations backed by PIV identity accounts and PIV credentials.

A companion document, the initial public draft of SP 800-157r1 _Guidelines for Derived PIV Credentials_, is [also available for public comment](https://pages.nist.gov/800-157r1/).  That draft provides revised guidelines for the issuance and maintenance of authenticators used as derived PIV credentials.
