# Note to Reviewers {#reviewers}
{: .no_toc}

The family of PIV credentials includes a variety of form factors and authenticator types â€“ as envisioned in OMB Memoranda M-19-22 and M-22-09 and subsequently outlined in FIPS 201-3. The cross-domain and interagency use of these credentials is provided by federation protocols outlined in this public draft SP 800-217 _Guidelines for PIV Federation_. The companion document, SP 800-157r1 _Guidelines for Derived PIV Credentials_, details the authenticators themselves. Both documents are closely aligned with draft release SP 800-63-4 _Digital Identity Guidelines_. NIST hopes that the draft document enable a close alignment with new and emerging digital identity and federation technologies employed in the federal government, while maintaining a strong security posture.

NIST is specifically interested in comments on and recommendations for the following topics:

**Home Agency Attributes**:

- Are additional attributes needed in the guidelines to achieve interagency or cross-domain interoperability?
- Are additional attributes required for RP provisioning and access?

**PIV Federation**:

- Are additional process steps or mechanism needed for the connection and communication between home-IdP-to PIV identity account?
- Do the required parameters for establishing trust agreements fit the use cases for PIV RPs?
- Are the required identity attributes sufficient for PIV use cases? 
- Are the federated subject identifier requirements sufficient for PIV use cases?
- Is it clear how to apply the binding ceremony for RP-managed bound authenticators at FAL3 to PIV and non-PIV authenticators?

Reviewers are encouraged to comment on all or part of both SP 800-157r1 and SP 800-217. NIST requests that all comments be submitted by 11:59pm Eastern Time on March 24, 2023. Please submit your comments to <mailto:piv_comments@nist.gov>. NIST will review all comments and make them available at the [NIST Computer Security Resource Center website](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-217/draft). Commenters are encouraged to use the comment template provided with the [document announcement](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-217/draft).
